I am Delu (Daniel) Kong , an exchange Ph.D. student now at the LT3 Language and Translation Technology Team, Ghent University, Belgium. My research interests include machine translation, post-editing, corpus-based translation studies, and digital humanities.

I am now pursuing my doctoral studies at the School of Foreign Studies, Tongji University, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Mei LI](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/May-Li-12). And I earned my master's degree from the School of English Studies, Shanghai International Studies University. During my academic journey, I received multiple awards, including provincial-level Outstanding Graduate recognitions and fellowship awards for three consecutive years.
